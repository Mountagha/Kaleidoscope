# Kaleidoscope
Kaleidoscope is a toy language implemented via LLVM infrastructure. The link to the tutorial can be found [here](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html)
### Disclaimer
Beware that this is a personal toy project through which I wish to learn LLVM infrastructure. 
### Future hacks
The [last chapter](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.html) of the tutorial gives a bunch of features to continue extending Kaleidoscope.
Here's some I planned to add in a near future
- [ ] Global variables 
- [ ] typed variables
- [ ] arrays, structs, vectors...
- [ ] standard runtime
- [ ] memory management
- [ ] exception handling
- [ ] ....
